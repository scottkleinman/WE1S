Make sure that you are using the appropriate file path for you system. If you have Mac, remove the `#` from the beginning of the second `input_path` and `output_path` lines and type it at the beginning of the first `input_path` and `output_path` lines, which contain `C:\\\\`. When you are finished, type `Shift+Enter`. If nothing happens, your configuration was successful. If you get an error, go back and check your file paths."
